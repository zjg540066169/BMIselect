Description: Implements five Bayesian MI-LASSO models for variable selection on 
  multiply-imputed datasets, using shrinkage priors (Multi_Laplace, Horseshoe, ARD) 
  and spike-and-slab priors (Spike_Normal, Spike_Laplace). Provides tools for MCMC-based 
  model fitting, posterior-based variable selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Methods 
  support continuous outcomes only.
