Description: Provides a suite of Bayesian MI-LASSO for variable selection methods for multiply-imputed datasets. The package includes four Bayesian MI-LASSO models using shrinkage (Multi-Laplace, Horseshoe, ARD) and Spike-and-Slab (Spike-and-Laplace) priors, along with tools for model fitting via MCMC, four-step projection predictive variable selection, and hyperparameter calibration. Methods are suitable for both continuous and binary covariates under missing-at-random or missing-completely-at-random assumptions. See Zou, J., Wang, S. and Chen, Q. (2025), Bayesian MI-LASSO for Variable Selection on Multiply-Imputed Data. ArXiv, 2211.00114. <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2211.00114> for more details. We also provide the frequentist`s MI-LASSO function.
